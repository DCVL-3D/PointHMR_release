## Overview :eyes:
- We propose to utilize the correspondence between encoded features and vertex positions, which are projected into the 2D space, via our point-guided feature sampling scheme. By explicitly indicating such vertex-relevant features to the transformer encoder, coordinates of the 3D human mesh are accurately estimated.
- Our progressive attention masking scheme helps the model efficiently deal with local vertex-to-vertex relations even under complicated poses and occlusions.
